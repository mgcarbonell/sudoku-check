# SUDOKU CHECKER

## Background:

An interview question that tripped me up a lot of bit, and because of that I'm going to complete it.

## The Problem:

Sudoku is a number placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with
digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids that
compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9 (with no duplicates).

This algorithm should check if the given grid of numbers represents a correct
solution to Sudoku.

### Example:

For...
```
grid = [
  [1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 9, 8, 7],
  [4, 6, 5, 8, 7, 9, 3, 2, 1],
  [7, 9, 8, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 4],
  [9, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 8, 7, 6],
  [3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 1, 9],
  [6, 8, 7, 1, 9, 2, 5, 4, 3],
  [5, 7, 6, 9, 8, 1, 4, 3, 2],
  [2, 4, 3, 6, 5, 7, 1, 9, 8],
  [8, 1, 9, 3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 5]
]
```
The output should be: `sudoku(grid) = true;`

For...
```
grid = [
  [1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 9, 2, 7],
  [4, 6, 5, 8, 7, 9, 3, 8, 1],
  [7, 9, 8, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 4],
  [9, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 8, 7, 6],
  [3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 1, 9],
  [6, 8, 7, 1, 9, 2, 5, 4, 3],
  [5, 7, 6, 9, 8, 1, 4, 3, 2],
  [2, 4, 3, 6, 5, 7, 1, 9, 8],
  [8, 1, 9, 3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 5]
]
```
The output should be: `sudoku(grid) = false;`

The output should be false: each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids should contain all
of the digits from 1 to 9.

### Summary:

1. Create 3 different functions to check if it is valid sudoku (row/col/3x3)
2. Loop through each function and check if it is valid
3. Return true if all functions pass.

## Solutions:

The languages that I will be completing this hopefully in will be Javascript and Python.
